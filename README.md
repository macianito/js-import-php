## Environments in which to use JS PHP Import

- Web Browser

## Requires

- PHP
- Javascript browser support

## Usage

Download the [code](https://github.com/macianito/js-import-php/) that is in the *php_server* folder of the project and include it in your HTML. 

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path_to_php_server/?app=path_to_app"></script>
```
The url paramameter(variable) **app** is optional, and it allows to set the path to the application that will be loaded. If not provided, the default application will be loaded

You can use the **$exported_fns** array to define which functions you want to load in your application.

 - To include functions, use the key *'fns'* and an array with the funcion's names as the associated value.

 - To include a class and its methods use name of the class as the key and an array with the method's names as the value of the key.

Also you can use the **$not_allowed_fns** array to don't allow whatever functions you put in it.


## Examples

We have several examples [on the website](https://mazius.org/). Here are some examples to get you started:
These examples will put the result of each called php function into a container on the page.

```jsx
$scandir(PATH_TO_FOLDER).then(function(result) {
  resultObj.html(result.join('<br>'));
});

$system('ls -l').then(function(result) {
  resultObj.append(result);
});

$str_replace(' ').then(function(result) {
  resultObj.append(result);
});

```

You can call a php function using the result of a previous called php function as a parameter, thus concatenating several function calls.
Here is an example of this.

```jsx
$testfn(34, 56).exec(function(result) { // first call
   return $testfn(34, result); // second call call with the result of the first call as a parameter
}).exec(function(result) {
   resultObj.append('result: ' + result + '<br><br>');
});
```
